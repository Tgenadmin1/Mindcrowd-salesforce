                            <p>Please read the following information before agreeing to participate in this research study.</p>
                            <p>This research study is conducted by Dr. Matt Huentelman at the Translational Genomic Research Institute (or TGen) in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of this scientific research study is to understand the factors that influence how the brain ages. We are interested in factors such as your lifestyle choices, your medical or family history, and even your genetic make-up. If we better understand how the brain ages, we may be able to understand what happens to people who experience an age-related brain disease (like Alzheimer's disease).</p>
                            <p ><span class=" question-text">What will I have to do?</span><br>
                              You will take one attention test and one memory test, and answer a few study-related questions.
                              </p>
                              <p ><span class="question-text">How will you use my information?</span><br>
                                  The information you provide and your test results will be used to study, analyze and understand how memory works in healthy people.
                                  </p>
                               <p>We may contact you again for future brain studies. Most studies will be performed online.</p>   
                               <p ><span class="question-text">How old do I have to be to participate?</span><br>
                                  18 years old or older.
                                  </p>   
                                  <p ><span class="question-text">What are my alternatives to being in this study?</span><br>
                                  This is not a treatment study. Your alternative is not to participate.
                                  </p>  
                                  <p ><span class="question-text">Are there any risks?</span><br>
                                  No. There are no risks associated with taking the brain tests.
                                  </p>  
                                  <p ><span class="question-text">Will I get paid?</span><br>
                                  No. 
                                  </p>  
                                  <p ><span class="question-text">Does it cost me anything to participate?</span><br>

                                  Sharing research data with other scientists is an important part of the research process and helps advance scientific progress. We will share de-identified data from this study with other researchers to help further research into the human brain. 
                                  </p>  
                                  <p ><span class="question-text">Will you share my personal information with other people?</span><br>
                                  No, we will not share your personal information without your permission. If you consent to participate in a MindCrowd collaborative study (or have previously done so), we may share or receive identifiable data such as your name or email address with our collaborative partners and your information could be shared with the FDA and the IRB overseeing this study. This would only be done to link your study data. 
                                  </p>  
                               <p class="padding0">To help protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. This means researchers may refuse to give out study information that identifies you. For example, if there were a court subpoena for study records, TGen would not give out information that identifies you, unless you have consented for this use. The Certificate does permit TGen to disclose
